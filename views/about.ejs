      This platform is a prototype implementation of a platform for live multimodal learning analytics for learn-from-home scenarios. Machine learning is used to extract certain data about the participants (e.g. emotion) from the webcam image and
      both transmit it live to the host of the session (usually the teacher) and store it for later analysis. The extraction of datapoints takes place exclusively on the user's device, the images themselves never leave the students device.
